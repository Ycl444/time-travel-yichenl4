I learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage branches, merge branches, handle conflicts, and push commits.  
My first mistake is making a commit for unchanging anything, I fix it by pushing first.  
My second mistake is using "echo ... >" to add new lines in current files. I use "ehco ... >>" to fix.  
"vi" really save me for creating a new file.
